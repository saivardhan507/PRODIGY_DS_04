## Overview

 This repository includes the code and documentation for my data science internship project at Prodigy Infotech, where I focused on Twitter sentiment analysis. The project's objective was to analyze sentiment patterns in Twitter data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards different topics, brands, and events.  

## Dataset

The <a href = "https://github.com/saivardhan507/PRODIGY_DS_04/blob/c6152a454cbe8b358dd4fe68f9c361ab228d0bd2/twitter_training.csv">`dataset`</a> used for this project consists of Twitter data collected from Kaggle.


## Conclusion

 Analyzing sentiments offers valuable insights into the predominant attitudes and opinions within the Twitter community on diverse topics. While negative sentiments are prevalent, a wide array of sentiments are expressed across different subjects. Understanding these trends can guide decision-making, shape marketing strategies, and enhance community engagement efforts in both online and offline settings.  <br>
